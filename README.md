# Genetic Algorithm for Flowshop and Jobshop Scheduling

## Overview
This project employs Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to address scheduling problems in both flowshop and jobshop environments. The primary objective is to minimize makespan, representing the total completion time for all jobs. The project is organized into three main modules: GA_Flowshop_Makespan, GA_Jobshop_Makespan, and GA_Jobshop_Makespan_Parallel.

## Modules

### 1. GA_Flowshop_Makespan
   - Focuses on solving the flowshop scheduling problem using a Genetic Algorithm to optimize makespan.

### 2. GA_Jobshop_Makespan
   - Dedicated to addressing the jobshop scheduling problem, this module utilizes a Genetic Algorithm to minimize makespan.

### 3. GA_Jobshop_Makespan_Parallel
   - Enhances the efficiency of the Genetic Algorithm for jobshop scheduling by incorporating parallel computing techniques to accelerate the solution process.
